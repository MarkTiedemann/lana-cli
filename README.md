# Lana! NPM scripts with better UX 🏓
![logo](site/logo.png)

## What?

Lana! provides a convenient, global API to browse and run NPM scripts in your projects.
Also, it makes managing your documentation easier by pulling out descriptions from your projects' README.md file.

## Why?

Do you happen to switch between your projects often and rely on reading package.json to look up the dev tasks? 
Well, I do. So give it a try. Your OCD will thank you.

## Why not?

There are many ways of tackling this issue, usually script names should be descriptive enough or one might say `package.json` is not the right place for that at all.

Normally, I'd agree with that, but it suits my workflow and might help you as well.

## Setup

> Supported Node.js version: `6.x.x` and higher

### Yarn
    $ yarn global add lana-cli

### NPM
    $ npm i -g lana-cli

## Usage

In a Javascript project with `package.json`, type:

    $ lana

You can share documentation between lana! and README.md by tagging content, like in this imaginary CMS (Cat Management System).

### Usage (documentation)

Add `<!--lana: NPM_TASK_NAME-->` at the end of a header or paragraph describing the task, and Lana will pick it up.

    #### Start a debug server <!--lana: start-->
        $ npm start

    #### Upload kittens <!--lana: upload-kittens-->
        $ npm run upload-kittens

    #### Download database for integration tests <!--lana: integration-db-download-->
        $ ./build/prepare_db.sh && npm run integration-db-download
